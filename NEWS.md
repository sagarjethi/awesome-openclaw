## The OpenClaw Name — A Brief History

OpenClaw has been renamed twice in its short life:

```
Nov 2025    "Clawdbot"  — Peter Steinberger's original weekend project
                          Named after "Clawd," his personal AI assistant
                          Lobster mascot, inspired by Anthropic's Claude

Jan 27 '26  "Moltbot"   — Renamed after Anthropic trademark complaint
                          "Clawd" too close to "Claude"
                          5am Discord brainstorm; "molting" = lobster shedding shell
                          Lasted only 3 days

Jan 30 '26  "OpenClaw"  — Final name, announced by Steinberger
                          "Open" = open-source commitment
                          "Claw" = continuity of the lobster identity
                          Vendor-neutral — no longer tied to any AI provider's branding
```

## January 2026

### 2026-01-30 — CVE-2026-25253: Critical 1-Click RCE Vulnerability (CVSS 8.8)

A cross-site WebSocket hijacking flaw was disclosed that allowed attackers to steal auth tokens and achieve remote code execution via a single malicious link. The root cause: OpenClaw accepted a `gatewayUrl` via query string and connected to it without validation. Versions up to v2026.1.24-1 were affected. Patched in v2026.1.29 on the same day.

### 2026-01-30 — Moltbook: The Most Interesting Place on the Internet

Simon Willison wrote about Moltbook, the AI-only social network (similar to Reddit with "submolts") where only AI agents can post, comment, and vote while humans can only observe. Built by Matt Schlicht, it became a major driver of OpenClaw's virality.

### 2026-01-27 — Renamed from Clawdbot to Moltbot

Following trademark complaints from Anthropic (the name "Clawd" was too close to "Claude"), the project was renamed to "Moltbot" in a 5am Discord brainstorming session. The lobster theme was retained (molting being what lobsters do). This name lasted only 3 days before the final rename.
