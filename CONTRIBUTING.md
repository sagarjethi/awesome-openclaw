# Contributing to Awesome OpenClaw

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This list is community-driven and we welcome high-quality additions.

## Guidelines

### Before Submitting

1. **Search for duplicates** — check the README to make sure the resource isn't already listed
2. **Verify the link works** — dead links will be rejected
3. **Check for security** — do not submit resources that distribute malware, contain known unpatched vulnerabilities, or are flagged on VirusTotal

### What to Include

- Open-source projects, tools, and libraries related to OpenClaw
- High-quality tutorials, guides, and articles
- Community resources and events
- Enterprise tools and deployment solutions

### What NOT to Include

- Affiliate links or promotional content
- Abandoned projects with no activity in 6+ months (unless historically significant)
- Duplicate resources that cover the same ground as existing entries
- Resources behind paywalls (unless clearly marked)
- Self-promotional submissions without demonstrated community value

### Formatting Rules

- **One resource per line** in tables
- **Add a brief description** — don't just drop a bare URL
- **Place entries alphabetically** within their section
- **Use the existing table format** — match the column structure of the section you're adding to
- **Keep descriptions concise** — one sentence, no marketing language

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b add-my-resource`
3. Make your changes to `README.md`
4. Verify all links work
5. Commit: `git commit -m "Add [resource-name] to [section]"`
6. Push: `git push origin add-my-resource`
7. Open a Pull Request with a clear title and description

### PR Title Format
